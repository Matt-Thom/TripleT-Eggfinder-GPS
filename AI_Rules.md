# Agent
- Always prioritise writing clean, simple and modular code.
- User simple and easy to understand language. Write in short sentences.
- Do NOT BE LAZY! Always read files IN FULL!!
- Push your changes to github REGULARLY, no REALLY if it's been more than 20k tokens it's been too long. Finish the current task, commit and then continue.
- Make the git commit comments simple but informative.

# Comments
- Write lots of command in your code. Explain exactly what yuo are doing in your comments.
- But be strategic, do not explain obvious syntax - instead explain your thought process at the time of writing the code!
- Never delete explanatory comments from the code you're editing (unless they are incorrect/obsolete)
- Focus on explaining the non-obvious stuff in the comments, the nuances / details
- DO NO delete comments currently in our code. If the comment is obsolete, or wrong, then update it - but NEVER mindlessly remove comments without reason.

# Documentation
- All documentation is ALWAYS in Markdown format. No exceptions.
- Documentation files MUST use .md extension. Never use .txt, .html, .rst, or other formats.
- Python docstrings MUST use Markdown formatting for consistency and readability.
- Always ensure that documentation is kept up to date. When code changes, documentation must be updated immediately.
- The README.md is for a high level overview of what the project does, what stage of development it is, what's coming up and how to use it.
- Project documentation is to be updated and work completed should be checked off the list. If the project documentation doesn't contain check marks add them.
- Monitor all documentation files regularly. Flag any files that are not in Markdown format.
- Python docstrings should include: function/class purpose, parameters (Args), return values (Returns), and exceptions (Raises) using Markdown formatting.
- Documentation should be consistent across all files. Use the same structure and formatting style throughout.
- When creating new documentation, always use Markdown format from the start. Convert any existing non-Markdown documentation to Markdown.
- Code examples in documentation must be properly formatted using Markdown code blocks with language tags.
- Documentation must be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use short sentences and simple language.
- Keep documentation organized. Use proper Markdown headings hierarchy (##, ###, ####) for structure.
- Update documentation whenever you modify code, add features, or fix bugs. Documentation and code must stay in sync.

# Header Comments
- Every file has to start with 4 lines of comments!
	1. exact file location in the codebase
	2. clear description of what this file does
	3. clear description of why this file exists
	4. RELEVANT FILES: comma-separated list of 2-4 most relevant files
- NEVER delete these "header comments" from the files you're editing.

Once you have read these visually indicate that you've read and understood them.
